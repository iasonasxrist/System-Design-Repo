# System Design Repository

This repository contains a collection of system design projects showcasing various technologies and concepts. Each project focuses on different aspects of system design, including load balancing, web application development, database management, multithreading, and algorithm implementations.

## Projects Included

1. **Load Balancer Web App**: A web application built using React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for database storage. Nginx is used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the web application.

2. **DynamoDB Application with Node.js**: An application developed in Node.js that utilizes Amazon DynamoDB as the database backend. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service offered by AWS, providing high availability and scalability.

3. **Multithreading**: Examples of multithreading implementations in various programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, C++) to demonstrate concurrency and parallel processing concepts.

4. **Merkle Tree Algorithms Implementation**: Implementations of Merkle tree data structures and algorithms. Merkle trees are used in distributed systems for efficient verification of data integrity and consistency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Concurrency**: Multithreading
- **Algorithm**: Merkle Tree
